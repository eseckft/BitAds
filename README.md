:no_entry_sign:**The Problem:**

The current advertising landscape, particularly as shaped by the web2 paradigm, presents significant challenges not only
for the users who are subjected to ads but also for the companies that invest heavily in advertising. At the heart of
these challenges are the highly centralized tech organizations that dominate and control the industry, such as Google
AdSense, Facebook Audience Network, and Apple Advertising. This centralized control results in a significant power
imbalance, lack of transparency, and high costs.

:bulb:**The Solution:**

The BitAds network emerges as a revolutionary solution, harnessing the power of blockchain technology to foster a
decentralized and incentivised advertising environment. By reimagining the foundational principles of advertising
transactions, BitAds seeks to rectify the issues of transparency, fraud, inefficiency, and the high costs associated
with conventional advertising methods.

# The BitAds.ai Ecosystem

**1. Validators, Miners, and BitAds Core:**

Validators create and manage advertising campaigns using the BitAds Core platform, which provides tools for creating
landing pages and tracking campaign performance. <br><br>
Miners generate unique links for campaigns to promote across the internet. They are rewarded with TAO tokens for driving
organic traffic to these links. BitAds Core acts as the central platform for campaign management, traffic analysis, and
miner validation.

**2. Incentive Mechanism:**
Miners are incentivized with TAO tokens, not based on the client's payment offer, but on the organic traffic they
attract. This system ensures cost-effective advertising for clients while rewarding miners substantially for their
efforts.

# Integration with Bittensor

BitAds leverages Bittensorâ€™s decentralized network to distribute advertising tasks among miners. <br><br>
Initially, BitAds will focus on promoting the Bittensor project itself, demonstrating the network's marketing
capabilities and incentivizing participation. <br><br>
Taking into consideration the potential emission of the subnet, this will potentially serve as the most powerful
marketing engine for the Bittensor project. <br><br>
By harnessing the collaborative efforts of the network's participants, BitAds aims to significantly enhance the
visibility and adoption of Bittensor, establishing a robust foundation for the future growth of both BitAds and
Bittensor.

# The First Incentivized Campaign

![alt text](docs/bittensor_campaign.png)<br>
The first
campaign ["Join the Bittensor Revolution where AI meets the Decentralization"](https://x.bitads.ai/lty9sdtvcg55s/) on
the BitAds Network will be BittensorWiki, a platform where you can find everything you need to know about the Bittensor
Network. <br>
In fact, this campaign will serve as a powerful marketing tool for the Bittensor Network, as miners will be incentivized
to generate organic traffic for the BittensorWiki campaign. <br>

# Income Sources for Validators

:white_check_mark:**Validators can monetize their participation in BitAds.ai Subnet through various avenues, including:
** <br>

- promoting their own products <br>
- engaging in affiliate marketing (for example - Amazon Affiliate Program, ClickBank) <br>
- developing applications using the BitAds.ai API <br>
- offering paid API access to others

# Scoring Mechanism

The scoring formula for BitAds miners incorporates a thoughtful approach to quantifying the effectiveness and impact of
miners based on two key performance indicators: Unique visits and Click-through rate (CTR).

:arrow_down:**Parameters and Normalization**

**Unique Visits (U)** <br>
This measures the total number of distinct visitors directed to the campaign via the miner's unique link. It's a direct
indicator of the reach and traffic generated by the miner.

**Click-Through Rate (CTR)** <br>
Expressed as a decimal, this metric captures the efficiency of the campaign in engaging visitors. Specifically, it
measures the proportion of visitors who click the "call to action" button and, if prompted, complete a captcha. A CTR of
5% is represented as 0.05, for example.

**Maximum Expected Values (Umax and CTRmax)** <br>
These thresholds are set to normalize the unique visits and CTR, ensuring they're scaled to a value between 0 and 1.
This normalization facilitates a fair comparison between miners, accounting for varying scales of performance. Let's say
Umax is set to 1000, and CTRmax is 0.15.

**Total number of visits for the period (V)** <br>

**Artificial traffic (AT)** <br>
Several metrics are taken into account to calculate the number of artificial visits over a period.

Normalization is performed as follows:

```bash
Unorm = U / Umax
CTRnorm = CTR / CTRmax
```

**Weight of Parameters (Wu and Wc)** <br>
These weights reflect the relative importance of Unique visits and CTR in calculating the miner's score. By adjusting
these weights, you can balance the emphasis on traffic generation versus engagement.<br> In our model, both parameters
are equally valued, with Wu = 0.5 and Wc = 0.5.

**Score Calculation** <br>
The Miner Score is computed by applying the weights to the normalized values of unique visits and CTR, as follows:

```bash
MINER SCORE = (( Wu * Unorm ) + ( Wc * CTRnorm )) * ( 1 - AT / V )
```

Given the example of a miner with 1000 unique visitors and a CTR of 5% (0.05), and with the normalization constants
provided (Umax = 1000, CTRmax = 0.15), the calculations would be:

```bash
Unorm = 1000 / 1000 = 1
CTRnorm = 0.05 / 0.15 = 0.333
```

Thus, the Miner Score would be:

```bash
MINER SCORE = (0.5 * 1) + (0.50 * 0.333) = 0.5 + 0.1665 = 0.6665
```

**Conditions and Adjustability:**

The formula caps the Miner Score at 1, ensuring scores remain within a 0 to 1 range. If the calculated score exceeds 1,
it's adjusted to 1, maintaining a standardized scoring scale.

Both the maximum expected values (Umax, CTRmax) and the weights (Wu, Wc) are configurable through the admin panel of
BitAds. <br> This flexibility allows you to recalibrate the scoring model based on evolving campaign goals, performance
benchmarks, or engagement strategies.

# Subnet Security

**BitAds campaigns have multiple levels of protection against fraudulent activity such as bot or script-driven fake
activity. In particular, verification for human authenticity occurs through:**

- AWS WAF [(Well-Architected Framework) ](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/)
- CAPTCHA

All incoming requests are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection by the web ACL. <br>

AWS WAF is a web security service that helps protect web applications from common web threats such as SQL injections,
cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). <br>

Human Verification Check is an additional layer of protection in AWS WAF, designed to help distinguish humans from bots.
It is useful for preventing automated attacks such as DDoS attacks and spam.
In BitAds.ai architecture it is one of the levels of protection against traffic manipulation. <br>

Each time the BidAds.ai API is accessed, validators' and miners' scripts transmit their Bittensor wallet keys for
verification of their presence in the registered users' database. BidAds also checks the status of each user (whether
they are active or blocked), as well as the compatibility of validators' and miners' script code versions with the
current version provided by BitAds.ai developers. This, on the one hand, requires users to constantly update their
scripts and prevents unauthorized interference with them. <br>

Additionally, every 30 minutes, there is an update of the lists of allowed participants in the process. Miners receive a
list of validators, and validators receive a list of miners with whom they can communicate. This way, the system is
protected from external intrusion.

# Roadmap

   Launch an interactive discord/telegram bot to provide miners with immediate access to campaign information and
   notifications.

6. **Traffic Source Analysis** <br>
   Implement traffic source analysis to precisely track visitor origins.

7. **Domain Selection Expansion** <br>
   Expand landing page domains to enable validators and clients to select from a wider range of options.

8. **Conversion Tracking** <br>
   Integrate conversion tracking in order to measure conversion rates on client websites.
